## Renaming hazard files with PHCode_HazCode format

1. Copy the script and the csv file to your file directory.
2. In the same directory, create a folder and store all the hazard files that need to be renamed. Note that this can only rename one hazard code at a time (LH_LH1 in this case).
3. Edit line 7, and change the folder name according to the folder you created in Step 2.
4. Run the script `renamer.py`.
